# Bug Tracking System
## Description 🗒️
The Bug Tracking System project is a comprehensive software application developed in Java that enables efficient tracking and management of bugs in software development. It leverages object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and scalable bug tracking solution. By utilizing the features and technologies mentioned earlier, it offers a wide range of capabilities for bug monitoring, assignment, and reporting.

The system allows developers to track the status of bugs, including their severity, priority, and assigned developer. It facilitates seamless bug assignment to the appropriate developers, ensuring effective bug management and resolution. The progress of bug fixes can be easily monitored, providing real-time insights into the status of each bug.

## Technologies & Features ⚒️
The system's GUI, developed using Java Swing, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bug tracking functionalities. It integrates an online shared MySQL storage as the database backend, ensuring reliable and secure data storage and retrieval.

In addition to bug tracking capabilities, the project also includes an authentication system that validates email addresses and ensures data integrity in the database. This adds an extra layer of security and prevents redundant or invalid data from being stored.

## Users 
The Bug Tracking System project accommodates multiple user roles, including testers, developers, project managers, and admins. Each role is equipped with specific functionalities tailored to their responsibilities and permissions. 

### Tester 🕵️
  - Define bugs with detailed information, including bug name, ID, type, priority, level of difficulty, project name, start date, and due date.
  - View all bugs defiend by them.
  - Interact with developers, assign bugs to specific developers.
  - Attach images to bug reports within the specified size limit (5MB).
  - Send email notifications to assigned developers with comprehensive bug details.
  - Host chat rooms for direct communication with developers.

### Developer 🧑‍💻
  - View all bugs assigned to them.
